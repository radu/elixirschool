# Learning Elixir with others - The Elixir Book Club

The Elixir community has no shortage of high-quality learning material, which leads to a problem: purchasing every Elixir book published while
reading only a few books front to back. Fortunately, it turns out that I was not alone in having this problem; other members of the Elixir Book
Club suffer from the same ailment.

I started the book club to bring together Elixir enthusiasts who were interested in learning together. In the spirit of open source,
we vote on the books that we read and even the time that we meet. Discussions take place on our Discord server and are informal. So far,
we have read Designing Elixir Systems With OTP by James Edward Gray / Bruce A. Tate and Property-Based Testing with PropEr, Erlang, and Elixir by Fred Hebert.

We meet every other Sunday to discuss two chapters from the book via Google Meet. It is a perfect chance to turn on our webcams and talk face-to-face.
Quite frequently, we transition to general Elixir talk after we finish the book discussion. I enjoy the face-to-face chat to get to know everyone, and there
is always something to learn. Whether it is a library or a specific tool, I leave knowing more than when I arrived.

We are always happy to have new people join; if you are interested in joining the Elixir book club, use the discord link below to join the server.
